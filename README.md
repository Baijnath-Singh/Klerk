# Klerk
# Project Overview: Klerk
## Inspiration
The inspiration for Klerk stemmed from the need to simplify interactions with government services, especially in regions with high linguistic diversity. Recognizing the challenges posed by language barriers in accessing government and legal services, we aimed to create a solution that bridges these gaps, providing clear and accessible information to all citizens. Klerk is designed to make official work less daunting and more efficient for everyone, regardless of their language proficiency.

## What It Does
Klerk is a multilingual assistant that facilitates seamless interactions with government services globally. Users can upload documents or input queries, select their target language, and receive translated responses. The application processes the input using Azure OpenAI, enhances it with relevant data from a Cosmos DB vector search, and provides accurate, context-aware responses in the desired language. Klerk supports a wide range of Indian regional languages and several international languages, making it a versatile tool for diverse linguistic needs.

## Use Cases
### Bridging Regional Language Barriers
Language barriers can significantly hinder people dealing with government or private institution paperwork if they do not understand the local language. This issue often discourages people from investing, purchasing land, or availing benefits of government schemes. Similarly, individuals who do not understand widely spoken languages like English but are fluent in a regional language face challenges. Klerk addresses this issue by translating documents into the user’s preferred language, making official paperwork accessible and understandable.

### Assisting Non-Regional Language Speakers
Imagine a person who only knows English, Hindi, and French visiting a government office in Karnataka, India, where all paperwork is in Kannada. This individual would struggle to understand the forms and documents. By inputting the document into Klerk and selecting the target language as English or another familiar language, they can easily understand the content and process.

### Providing Updated Government Information
Klerk’s backend logic accesses an Azure Cosmos DB populated with the latest government rules, regulations, and policies for various departments, collected from official departmental websites. These documents are vectorized and indexed. When a user has a query related to a government scheme, Klerk provides updated, relevant, and specific details, ensuring the information is comprehensive and current. The current version focuses on documents related to "Will" processing, providing detailed and updated information for related queries.

### Specific Information Retrieval
Klerk's system and user prompt optimization facilitate quick and precise information retrieval. For example, if a user needs only the name and address from a sale deed document or types "detailed information" as a query, Klerk will display a response tailored to the user’s specific request. This system and user prompt optimization facilitate quick and precise information retrieval.

### Facilitating Government Office Work
Government office work is often not organized enough for individuals to complete tasks independently. People typically seek help from official/unofficial clerks to initiate processes. Klerk assists by providing information about professional and knowledgeable clerks who can guide users through their intended work. Users can gather information about government departments, office locations, and clerks with just a few clicks, enabling them to communicate with clerks in advance and understand the requirements before visiting the departmental office. Klerk’s team maintains ratings for unofficial clerks based on past services, allowing users to choose the most suitable clerk for their needs.

## How We Built It
**Frontend Development:** Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload documents, input queries, and select target languages.

**Backend Development:** Implemented with Flask, our backend manages user requests, processes documents, and interfaces with AI and database services.

**Azure OpenAI Integration:** Leveraged Azure OpenAI for processing and translating documents and queries, ensuring high accuracy in language processing.

**Azure AI Document Intelligence Read Model:** Incorporated this model to process input files and return their content accurately.

**Azure Cosmos DB for Vector Search:** Employed Cosmos DB's vector search capabilities to augment user queries with relevant information from our knowledge base.

**Seamless Integration and Deployment:** Achieving seamless integration of various technologies and automated deployment using GitHub and Azure WebApp.

## Lessons Learned
**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Gained in-depth knowledge of leveraging Azure OpenAI for understanding and generating human language.

**Vector Databases:** Learned the intricacies of using Cosmos DB for efficient and accurate vector searches.

**User Experience Design:** Understood the importance of designing an interface that is both intuitive and accommodating to users from diverse backgrounds.
Integration Challenges: Overcame technical challenges associated with integrating multiple technologies and ensuring smooth data flow.

**CI/CD Practices:** Enhanced our understanding and implementation of continuous integration and deployment practices using GitHub and Azure WebApp.

## Adherence to Azure Responsible AI Principles
**Fairness:** Klerk ensures fairness by providing accurate translations for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds. This reduces language barriers and ensures equal access to government services and legal information for all users, regardless of their native language.

**Reliability and Safety:** Klerk leverages Azure AI Document Intelligence Read Model and Azure OpenAI for reliable and accurate content processing. Rigorous testing and validation ensure that translations and information retrieval are dependable and safe for users, minimizing the risk of errors.

**Privacy and Security:** Klerk adheres to strict privacy guidelines by not storing or retaining any uploaded documents on its servers. All document processing occurs locally on the user’s device, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and private.

**Inclusiveness:** Klerk supports multiple languages, including various Indian regional languages and several international languages, ensuring inclusiveness. The user-friendly interface is designed to be accessible to people from diverse backgrounds, including those with different language proficiencies and technical skills.

**Transparency:** Klerk maintains transparency by clearly informing users about the application's functionalities, limitations, and data processing methods in the terms and conditions. Users are aware that the application is in the Beta version, and the translation accuracy may have minor imperfections.

**Accountability:** Klerk provides a feedback loop where users can share their experiences and suggestions. This feedback mechanism allows for continuous improvement of the system, ensuring that the developers are accountable for the application's performance and user satisfaction.
